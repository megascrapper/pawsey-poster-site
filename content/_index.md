blurb: Internet of Things and smart buildings are all the rage nowadays. While these systems can improve comfort and efficiency, many of these smart systems were built with *very* little regard to privacy. We are developing an anomaly detection system in time series building IoT data. Also, we identified its privacy threats and propose ways we can mitigate those threats.
