		"abstract": "Many countries worldwide face challenges in controlling building incidence prevention measures for fire disasters. The most critical issues are the localization, identification, detection of the room occupant. Internet of Things (IoT) along with machine learning proved the increase of the smartness of the building by providing real-time data acquisition using sensors and actuators for prediction mechanisms. This paper proposes the implementation of an IoT framework to capture indoor environmental parameters for occupancy multivariate time-series data. The application of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning algorithm is used to infer the knowledge of the presence of human beings. An experiment is conducted in an office room using multivariate time-series as predictors in the regression forecasting problem. The results obtained demonstrate that with the developed system it is possible to obtain, process, and store environmental information. The information collected was applied to the LSTM algorithm and compared with other machine learning algorithms. The compared algorithms are Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve Bayes Network, and Multilayer Perceptron Feed-Forward Network. The outcomes based on the parametric calibrations demonstrate that LSTM performs better in the context of the proposed application.",

		"abstract": "Nano-scaled structures, wireless sensing, wearable devices, and wireless communications systems are anticipated to support the development of new next-generation technologies in the near future. Exponential rise in future Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas such as wearable consumer electronics, remote healthcare monitoring, wireless implants, and smart buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel, non-wearable, device-free, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router, network interface card, and an omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without deploying a device on person‚Äôs body. The Wi-Fi signals received using non-wearable devices are converted into time‚Äìfrequency scalograms. The occupancy is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural network. In addition to occupancy detection, the deep neural network also identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover, a novel encryption algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is 91.1%.",

		"abstract": "Information about room-level occupancy is crucial to many building-related tasks, such as building automation or energy performance simulation. Current occupancy detection literature focuses on data-driven methods, but is mostly based on small case studies with few rooms. The necessity to collect room-specific data for each room of interest impedes applicability of machine learning, especially data-intensive deep learning approaches, in practice. To derive accurate predictions from less data, we suggest knowledge transfer from synthetic data. In this paper, we conduct an experiment with data from a CO$_2$ sensor in an office room, and additional synthetic data obtained from a simulation. Our contribution includes (a) a simulation method for CO$_2$ dynamics under randomized occupant behavior, (b) a proof of concept for knowledge transfer from simulated CO$_2$ data, and (c) an outline of future research implications. From our results, we can conclude that the transfer approach can effectively reduce the required amount of data for model training.",

		"abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices have become ubiquitous and interconnected in daily lives. Because wearable devices collect, transmit, and monitor humans‚Äô physiological signals, data privacy should be a concern, as well as fully protected, throughout the whole process. However, the existing privacy protection methods are insufficient. In this paper, we propose a practical privacy-preserving mechanism for physiological signals collected by intelligent wearable devices. In the data acquisition and transmission stage, we employed existing asymmetry encryption-based methods. In the data publishing stage, we proposed a new model based on the combination and optimization of k-anonymity and differential privacy. An entropy-based personalized k-anonymity algorithm is proposed to improve the performance on processing the static and long-term data. Moreover, we use the symmetry of differential privacy and propose the temporal differential privacy mechanism for real-time data to suppress the privacy leakage while updating data. It is proved theoretically that the combination of the two algorithms is reasonable. Finally, we use smart bracelets as an example to verify the performance of our mechanism. The experiment results show that personalized k-anonymity improves up to 6.25% in terms of security index compared with traditional k-anonymity, and the grouping results are more centralized. Moreover, temporal differential privacy effectively reduces the amount of information exposed, which protects the privacy of IoT-based users.",

		"abstract": "Privacy and security are among the significant challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT). Improper device updates, lack of efficient and robust security protocols, user unawareness, and famous active device monitoring are among the challenges that IoT is facing. In this work, we are exploring the background of IoT systems and security measures, and identifying (a) different security and privacy issues, (b) approaches used to secure the components of IoT-based environments and systems, (c) existing security solutions, and (d) the best privacy models necessary and suitable for different layers of IoT driven applications. In this work, we proposed a new IoT layered model: generic and stretched with the privacy and security components and layers identification. The proposed cloud/edge supported IoT system is implemented and evaluated. The lower layer represented by the IoT nodes generated from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) as Virtual Machines. The middle layer (edge) implemented as a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware kit with support of the Greengrass Edge Environment in AWS. We used the cloud-enabled IoT environment in AWS to implement the top layer (the cloud). The security protocols and critical management sessions were between each of these layers to ensure the privacy of the users‚Äô information. We implemented security certificates to allow data transfer between the layers of the proposed cloud/edge enabled IoT model. Not only is the proposed system model eliminating possible security vulnerabilities, but it also can be used along with the best security techniques to countermeasure the cybersecurity threats facing each one of the layers; cloud, edge, and IoT.",

		"abstract": "Privacy issues have plagued the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Resource-constrained IoT devices often obscure transparency for end-users. A lack of transparency and control complicates user trust in IoT. Additionally, a growing history of misuse and abuse exists in IoT. Notably, a smart TV has periodically scanned and collected users‚Äô private information without consent, while power companies have adjusted the temperature of smart thermostats during heat waves. Due to a hybrid of distributed ecosystems within IoT, users cannot easily implement traditional access control over their devices as data flows within different nodes for storage and processing. A misunderstanding of IoT privacy issues and growing privacy fatigue by consumers further complicate this problem. The usability of privacy-preserving mechanisms and tools offers promise but relies on accurately capturing privacy preferences. In this dissertation, we demonstrate how we tackled the aforementioned challenges through understanding users‚Äô privacy choices and providing the necessary means to help them enforce their privacy. First, we replicate a previous study to examine users‚Äô privacy expectations and preferences for IoT devices. We specifically focus our effort on examining users‚Äô feelings regarding their data collection in an IoT-based environment. Our work analyzes different contributing factors that impact users‚Äô privacy decisions about data collection. Our analysis supports previous work that has argued users‚Äô perceived benefit is an essential factor and motivating favor. In contrast to the previous study, we identified the workplace has now morphed into a sensitive location where users are uncomfortable sharing their private information. Second, we propose MQTT-based Privacy Orchestrator (MPO) to implement traditional access control on IoT devices. MPOenforces privacy preferences by implementing access control at an MQTT broker. Through MPO implementation, we demonstrate a practical and scalable solution to facilitate users‚Äô privacy preferences and enforce access control for MQTT-based devices. Third, we examine the usability of MPO to ensure that users have a usable tool they can utilize to enforce their privacy choices. We analyze MPO‚Äôs ability to mitigate the privacy fatigue phenomenon.",

		"abstract": "Security and privacy of users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.",

		"abstract": "The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects a number of intelligent devices with minimum human interference that can interact with one another. IoT is rapidly emerging in the areas of computer science. However, new security problems are posed by the cross-cutting design of the multidisciplinary elements and IoT systems involved in deploying such schemes. Ineffective is the implementation of security protocols, i.e., authentication, encryption, application security, and access network for IoT systems and their essential weaknesses in security. Current security approaches can also be improved to protect the IoT environment effectively. In recent years, deep learning (DL)/machine learning (ML) has progressed significantly in various critical implementations. Therefore, DL/ML methods are essential to turn IoT system protection from simply enabling safe contact between IoT systems to intelligence systems in security. This review aims to include an extensive analysis of ML systems and state-of-the-art developments in DL methods to improve enhanced IoT device protection methods. On the other hand, various new insights in machine and deep learning for IoT securities illustrate how it could help future research. IoT protection risks relating to emerging or essential threats are identified, as well as future IoT device attacks and possible threats associated with each surface. We then carefully analyze DL and ML IoT protection approaches and present each approach‚Äôs benefits, possibilities, and weaknesses. This review discusses a number of potential challenges and limitations. The future works, recommendations, and suggestions of DL/ML in IoT security are also included.",

At the same time, IoT technologies introduce challenging privacy issues that may frustrate their widespread adoption. This chapter addresses the privacy challenges of IoT technologies from a user-centered perspective and demonstrates these prevalent issues in the domains of wearables (e.g., fitness trackers), household technologies (e.g., smart voice assistants), and devices that exist in the public domain (e.g., security cameras). The chapter ends with a comprehensive list of solutions and guidelines that can help researchers and practitioners introduce usable privacy to the domain of IoT.",

		"abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet-enabled devices that can sense, communicate, and react to changes in their environment. Billions of these computing devices are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life. However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such, privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform layer, and application layer.",

		"abstract": "Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.\n            This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.",

In this work, we answer these key questions by conducting (to our best knowledge) the most comprehensive anomaly detection benchmark with 30 algorithms on 57 benchmark datasets, named ADBench. Our extensive experiments (98,436 in total) identify meaningful insights into the role of supervision and anomaly types, and unlock future directions for researchers in algorithm selection and design. With ADBench, researchers can easily conduct comprehensive and fair evaluations for newly proposed methods on the datasets (including our contributed ones from natural language and computer vision domains) against the existing baselines. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, we fully open-source ADBench and the corresponding results.",

In this work we propose ELECT, a new approach to select an effective candidate model, i.e. an outlier detection algorithm and its hyperparameter(s), to employ on a new dataset without any labels. At its core, ELECT is based on meta-learning; transferring prior knowledge (e.g. model performance) on historical datasets that are similar to the new one to facilitate UOMS. Uniquely, it employs a dataset similarity measure that is performance-based, which is more direct and goal-driven than other measures used in the past. ELECT adaptively searches for similar historical datasets, as such, it can serve an output on-demand, being able to accommodate varying time budgets. Extensive experiments show that ELECT significantly outperforms a wide range of basic UOMS baselines, including no model selection (always using the same popular model such as iForest) as well as more recent selection strategies based on meta-features.",

		"abstract": "Given an unsupervised outlier detection task, how should one select i) a detection algorithm, and ii) associated hyperparameter values (jointly called a model)? EÔ¨Äective outlier model selection is essential as diÔ¨Äerent algorithms may work well for varying detection tasks, and moreover their performance can be quite sensitive to the values of the hyperparameters (HPs). On the other hand, unsupervised model selection is notoriously diÔ¨Écult, in the absence of hold-out validation data with ground-truth labels. Therefore, the problem is vastly understudied in the outlier mining literature. There exists a body of work that propose internal model evaluation strategies for selecting a model. These so-called internal strategies solely rely on the input data (without labels) and the output (outlier scores) of the candidate models. In this paper, we Ô¨Årst survey internal model evaluation strategies including both those proposed speciÔ¨Åcally for outlier detection, as well as those that can be adapted from the unsupervised deep representation learning literature. Then, we investigate their eÔ¨Äectiveness empirically in comparison to simple baselines such as random selection and the popular state-of-the-art detector Isolation Forest (iForest) with default HPs. To this end, we set up (and open-source) a large testbed with 39 detection tasks and 297 candidate models comprised of 8 different detectors and various HP conÔ¨Ågurations. We evaluate internal strategies from 7 diÔ¨Äerent families on their ability to discriminate between models w.r.t. detection performance, without using any labels. Our study reports a striking Ô¨Ånding, that none of the existing and adapted strategies would be practically useful : stand-alone ones are not signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from random, and consensus-based ones do not outperform iForest (w/ default HPs) while being more expensive (as all candidate models need to be trained for evaluation). Our survey stresses the importance of and the standing need for eÔ¨Äective unsupervised outlier model selection, and acts as a call for future work on the problem.",

		"abstract": "Outlier detection (OD) is a key learning task for finding rare and deviant data samples, with many time-critical applications such as fraud detection and intrusion detection. In this work, we propose TOD, the first tensor-based system for efficient and scalable outlier detection on distributed multi-GPU machines. A key idea behind TOD is decomposing complex OD applications into a small collection of basic tensor algebra operators. This decomposition enables TOD to accelerate OD computations by leveraging recent advances in deep learning infrastructure in both hardware and software. Moreover, to deploy memory-intensive OD applications on modern GPUs with limited on-device memory, we introduce two key techniques. First, provable quantization speeds up OD computations and reduces its memory footprint by automatically performing specific floating-point operations in lower precision while provably guaranteeing no accuracy loss. Second, to exploit the aggregated compute resources and memory capacity of multiple GPUs, we introduce automatic batching, which decomposes OD computations into small batches for both sequential execution on a single GPU and parallel execution on multiple GPUs. TOD supports a diverse set of OD algorithms. Extensive evaluation on 11 real and 3 synthetic OD datasets shows that TOD is on average 10.9x faster than the leading CPU-based OD system PyOD (with a maximum speedup of 38.9x), and can handle much larger datasets than existing GPU-based OD systems. In addition, TOD allows easy integration of new OD operators, enabling fast prototyping of emerging and yet-to-discovered OD algorithms.",

These smart devices can capture and share sensitive and private data about occupants, exposing them to various privacy threats. Nevertheless, the convenience offered by these devices influences users' privacy-related behaviours, and they rarely make active efforts to protect their personal information. To address this tension between data privacy, consent and convenience, this thesis proposes a novel privacy-preserving informed consent management solution.

Users can freely construct a pipeline using these primitives and perform end- to-end outlier detection with the constructed pipeline. TODS provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), where users can flexibly design a pipeline with drag-and-drop.
